Contained in this repo are some .sql files for producing overly simplified sample databases with completely made up data for practicing MySQL.

Each file has commentation containing some sample queries that can work with the table(s) in that particular database, along with what each query is grabbing in plain English.

I hope these can be of some use to anyone just starting to learn MySQL, as they did help me in practicing.

I will possibly update them and or add more as I learn more and fix some noob assumptions I have on building a database, but they will stay simple for practice purposes.
